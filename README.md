# Using-Transfer-Learning-to-classify-new-voice-commands-

This project aims to implement automatic graph-versioning with transfer learning for classifying new labels. The new versions correspond to different versions of the final softmax layers, each version with new labels to train.

The project is implemented fully in Tensorflow, using single-word voice commands data from the Tensorflow Simple Audio Recognition Tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio_recognition.
